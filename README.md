# Stars

In this project I will be using random forests and neural network algorithims to classify stars. In astronomy classification of astronomical objects is a big subject since there are so many types of objects that can be observed in the night sky. The classification is based soley on their spectral charactersitics, like their redshift. Althought many more features come into play which we will dicuss below in the project. The dataset is collected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17. Here is an image from the survey:
